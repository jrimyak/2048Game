PROJECT TITLE: 2048
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
VERSION or DATE:
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: ALex Beckerman, Justin Kastler, Jake Imyak, Jesse Brodacz
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
To Run the Game: Run the Main method in the "Game" class

Check Point 1
In the project so far we have made some decent progress. 
Jake has completed the Tile class, along with its tester. 
Alex and Justin are working on the GUI/Game classes, with the GUI almost complete. 
Jesse had been helping everyone in a myriad of ways thus far. 
We need to complete the grid and figure out how to make the tile spawn and stop when it hits another tile and add together. 
We also need to figure out how to add multiple tiles at one time, as well as adding javadoc to all classes.

Check Point 2
We all have been working diligently at the grid class to combine tiles 
and get all the different movements to work. However, there are some problems when combining, usually
the combination will work fine, but then one of the tiles will not move properly, such as staying in the 
same position for a while or combining into the wrong position and then staying there despite
other commands. Currently, Slide Up works perfectly, normal, but down, right, left will sometimes fail
to slide properly, with slide left being successful more often
We are trying to finish the text based version so we can start on the GUI and arrow-key input.
